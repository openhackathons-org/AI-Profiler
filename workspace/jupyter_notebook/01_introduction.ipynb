Finding hotspots and bottlenecks in your application can help you decide where to focus your optimization efforts."

Start with `Nsight Systems` to get a system-level overview of the workload and eliminate any system level bottlenecks, such as unnecessary thread synchronization or data movement, and improve the system level parallelism of your algorithms to scale efficiently across any number or size of CPUs and GPUs. Once you have done that, then proceed to `Nsight Compute` or `Nsight Graphics` to optimize the most significant CUDA kernels or graphics workloads, respectively. Periodically return to Nsight Systems to ensure that you remain focused on the largest bottleneck. Otherwise, the bottleneck may have shifted and your kernel level optimizations may not achieve high improvement as expected.\n",
