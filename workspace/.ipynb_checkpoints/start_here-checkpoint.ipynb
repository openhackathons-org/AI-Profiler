    "This lab is presented in two parts: part 1  and 2. Part 1 discusses profiling using NVIDIA® Nsight™ Systems, while part 2 explains the application of PyTorch Profiler with TensorBoard plugin. Both parts focus on steps to optimize a deep neural network (DNN) training program that detects handwritten digits using a PyTorch Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset. The techniques and strategies discussed in this lab will translate to  optimizing any application that uses NVIDIA's graphic processing units (GPUs).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn how to do the following:\n",
    "- Run the sample application,\n",
    "- Use NVIDIA Nsight Systems to profile the application,\n",
    "- Use PyTorch Profiler to profile the application and visualize it on TensorBoard,\n",
    "- Interpret the timeline provided by NVIDIA Nsight Systems and understand the application's use of the system resources,\n",
    "- Use TensorBoard execution summary, step time breakdown, and performance recommendation to understand the application's use of the system resources,\n",
    "- Identify performance problems in the application and apply optimization strategies, and Confirm the performance improvement gained from the optimizations.\n"
